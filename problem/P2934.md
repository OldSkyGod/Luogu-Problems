# [USACO09JAN]Safe Travel G

## 题目描述

Gremlins have infested the farm. These nasty, ugly fairy-like

creatures thwart the cows as each one walks from the barn (conveniently located at pasture\_1) to the other fields, with cow\_i traveling to from pasture\_1 to pasture\_i. Each gremlin is personalized and knows the quickest path that cow\_i normally takes to pasture\_i. Gremlin\_i waits for cow\_i in the middle of the final cowpath of the quickest route to pasture\_i, hoping to harass cow\_i.

Each of the cows, of course, wishes not to be harassed and thus chooses an at least slightly  different route from pasture\_1 (the barn) to pasture\_i.

Compute the best time to traverse each of these new not-quite-quickest routes that enable each cow\_i that avoid gremlin\_i who is located on the final cowpath of the quickest route from pasture\_1 to

pasture\_i.

As usual, the M (2 <= M <= 200,000) cowpaths conveniently numbered 1..M are bidirectional and enable travel to all N (3 <= N <= 100,000) pastures conveniently numbered 1..N. Cowpath i connects pastures a\_i (1 <= a\_i <= N) and b\_i (1 <= b\_i <= N) and requires t\_i (1 <= t\_i <= 1,000) time to traverse. No two cowpaths connect the same two pastures, and no path connects a pasture to itself (a\_i != b\_i). Best of all, the shortest path regularly taken by cow\_i from pasture\_1 to pasture\_i is unique in all the test data supplied to your program.

By way of example, consider these pastures, cowpaths, and [times]:

```cpp
1--[2]--2-------+ 
|       |       | 
[2]     [1]     [3] 
|       |       | 
+-------3--[4]--4
```
``` 
TRAVEL     BEST ROUTE   BEST TIME   LAST PATH 
p_1 to p_2       1->2          2         1->2 
p_1 to p_3       1->3          2         1->3 
p_1 to p_4      1->2->4        5         2->4 
```
When gremlins are present:

```cpp
TRAVEL     BEST ROUTE   BEST TIME    AVOID 
p_1 to p_2     1->3->2         3         1->2 
p_1 to p_3     1->2->3         3         1->3 
p_1 to p_4     1->3->4         6         2->4 
```
For 20% of the test data, N <= 200. 

For 50% of the test data, N <= 3000. 

TIME LIMIT: 3 Seconds

## 输入格式

\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and M

\* Lines 2..M+1: Three space-separated integers: a\_i, b\_i, and t\_i


## 输出格式

\* Lines 1..N-1: Line i contains the smallest time required to travel from pasture\_1 to pasture\_i+1 while avoiding the final cowpath of the shortest path from pasture\_1 to pasture\_i+1. If no such path exists from pasture\_1 to pasture\_i+1, output -1 alone on the line.
