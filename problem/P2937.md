# [USACO09JAN]Laserphones S

## 题目描述

The cows have a new laser-based system so they can have casual conversations while out in the pasture which is modeled as a W x H grid of points (1 <= W <= 100; 1 <= H <= 100).

The system requires a sort of line-of-sight connectivity in order to sustain communication. The pasture, of course, has rocks and trees that disrupt the communication but the cows have purchased diagonal mirrors ('/' and '\' below) that deflect the laser beam through a 90 degree turn. Below is a map that illustrates the

problem.

H is 8 and W is 7 for this map.  The two communicating cows are notated as 'C's; rocks and other blocking elements are notated as '\*'s:

```cpp
7 . . . . . . .         7 . . . . . . . 
6 . . . . . . C         6 . . . . . /-C

```
Determine the minimum number of mirrors M that must be installed to maintain laser communication between the two cows, a feat which is always possible in the given test data.

奶牛们都改用激光进行通讯了.

在W\*H的牧场上，一些地方有树木和石头遮挡激光，所以，奶 牛打算使用对角镜来进行激光通讯.两只奶牛的位置是固定的，对角镜能把光线旋转90度.
