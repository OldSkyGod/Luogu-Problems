# [USACO12FEB]Cow IDs S

## 题目描述

Being a secret computer geek, Farmer John labels all of his cows with binary numbers.  However, he is a bit superstitious, and only labels cows with binary numbers that have exactly K "1" bits (1 <= K <= 10).  The leading bit of each label is always a "1" bit, of course.  FJ assigns labels in increasing numeric order, starting from the smallest possible valid label -- a K-bit number consisting of all "1" bits.  Unfortunately, he loses track of his labeling and needs your help: please determine the Nth label he should assign (1 <= N <= 10^7).

FJ给他的奶牛用二进制进行编号，每个编号恰好包含K 个"1"  (1 <= K <= 10)，且必须是1开头。FJ按升序编号，第一个编号是由K个"1"组成。


请问第N(1 <= N <= 10^7)个编号是什么。
