# [POI2013]MUL-Multidrink

## 题目描述

Byteasar lives in Byteburg, a city famous for its milk bars on every corner.

One day Byteasar came up with an idea of a "milk multidrink": he wants to  visit each milk bar for a drink exactly once.

Ideally, Byteasar would like to come up with a route such that the next bar  is always no further than two blocks (precisely: intersections) away from the  previous one.

The intersections in Byteburg are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.2.png),  and all the streets are bidirectional.

Between each pair of intersections there is a unique direct route, ie, one  that does not visit any intersection twice.

Byteasar begins at the intersection no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.3.png) and finishes at the intersection  no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.4.png).

Your task is to find any route that satisfies Byteasar's requirements if such  a route exists.

An exemplary route satisfying the requirements is: ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.5.png)                There is no route that satisfies the requirements.

给一棵树，每次步伐大小只能为1或2，要求不重复的遍历n个节点，且起点为1，终点为n


## 输入格式

In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.6.png)  (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.7.png)), denoting the number of intersections in Byteburg.

Each of the following ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.8.png) lines holds a pair of distinct integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.9.png)  and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.10.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.11.png)), separated by a single space, that  represent the street linking the intersections no. ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.12.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.13.png).

In tests worth ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.14.png) of all points the condition ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.15.png) holds.


## 输出格式

If there is no route satisfying Byteasar's requirements, your program  should print a single word "BRAK" (Polish for none),  without the quotation marks to the standard output.  Otherwise, your program  should print ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.16.png) lines to the standard output, the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.17.png)-th of which should  contain the number of the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.18.png)-th intersection on an arbitrary route  satisfying Byteasar's requirements.  Obviously, in that case the first line  should hold the number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.19.png), and the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.20.png)-th line - number ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/mul-en-tex.21.png).
