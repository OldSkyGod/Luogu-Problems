# [NWRRC2015]Black and White

## 题目描述



The jury has a great artistic idea -- to create a rectangular panel out of a huge pile of black and white squares of the same size. The panel should have exactly $b 4-connected$ areas made of black tiles, and $w 4-connected$ areas made of white tiles.

Remember, a $4-connected$ area of some color is a maximal set of the panel tiles such that:

any two tiles of the area share the same color;

for any two tiles of the area there is a tile sequence connecting them, such that any two consecutive tiles of the sequence share a common side.

In addition to the artistic idea, the jury has already developed a program that produces design of the panel. But since this problem is about art, any new solution is extremely important for the jury.



## 输入格式



The only line of the input file contains two integers $b$ and $w$ -- number of black and white areas $(1 \le b , w \le 1000)$ .



## 输出格式



The first line of the output file should contain the picture sizes $r$ and $c$ -- the number of rows and columns $(1 \le r , c \le 100 000)$ . This line should be followed by $r$ lines of $c$ symbols each. Each symbol should be either $‘@'$ (for black tile) or $‘. '$ (for white one). There should be no more than $100 000$ tiles in the panel.
