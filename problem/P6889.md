# [CEOI2006] CONNECT

## 题目描述

Back in the day when the famous sixteen-bit three-letter operating system most often used on an 25x80 terminal dominated the PC market, "Nibbles" was everyone's favorite computer game. This problem, however, is not related to Nibbles – it is related to a game called "Connect" which is almost, but not quite, entirely unlike
Nibbles.

Connect is played on a board composed of squares organized into R rows and $C$ columns, where both $R$ and $C$ are **odd numbers**. Rows and columns are numbered $1$ to $R$ and $1$ to $C$, respectively. Each position on the board
is either free or blocked by a wall. Additionally, each board satisfies the following constraints:

- Squares with **both coordinates even** are called rooms. They are **never blocked**.
- Squares with **both coordinates odd** are called barriers. They are **always blocked**
- All other squares are called corridors. They may or may not be blocked.
- Corridors **along the edge** of the board are **always blocked**.

Barriers are represented by the '+' (plus) character, blocked horizontal corridors by the '|' (pipe) character, while blocked vertical corridors are represented by the '–' (minus) character. Rooms and free corridors are represented by the blank character.

  At the beginning of the game an **even number** of figures (represented by the uppercase letter 'X') are placed on the board – each in a separate **room**. $A$ path between figures $A$ and $B$ is a sequence of **free** squares starting from $A$, ending with $B$ and moving in one of the **four possible directions** in each step (the path includes both endpoint squares, $A$ and $B$). The length of the path is the total number of steps needed to get from $A$ to $B$  (which is equal to the number of squares contained in the path minus one).

  The goal of the player is to first **divide all the figures into pairs**, and then, for each pair, **connect** the two figures with a path. The pairs should be connected in such a way that **no two paths share a common square**.

  For a completed game, the score is defined as **the sum of the lengths** of all paths.

Write a program that, given the starting position of the Connect game, plays the game in such a way that the **minimum possible score** is achieved.
The test data will guarantee that a solution, although not necessarily unique, will always exist. 





## 输入格式

第一行输入为两个整数： $R$ 与 $C$ ,其中 $R$ 为行数，$C$ 为列数，$R$ ，$C$ 均为奇数。

接下来的 $R$ 行每行包括 $C$ 个字符，每个字符都是`+`、`|`、`- `、空格或`X`中的一个，分别表示障碍及两种墙壁、空格表示房间或可通过的走廊，`X`表示房间中的物品。

## 输出格式

输出的第一行是一个整数，即最小分值。

本题**不要求**输出合法方案
