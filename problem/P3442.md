# [POI2006]NAJ-The Invasion

## 题目描述

And so it has come - the Triangles have invaded Byteotia!

Byteotia lies on an island, occupying its entire surface.

The shape of the island is a convex polygon(i.e. a polygon whose each inner angle is smaller than $180\degree$).

A certain number of software factories are located in Byteotia, each of which generates constant gains or losses.

The Triangles have decided to occupy such a part of Byteotia which:

is a triangle-shaped area, the vertices of which are three different vertices of the polygon-island,     brings the largest income i.e. the sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within the occupied area is maximal.

We assume that a factory located on the border or in the vertex of occupied area belongs to that area. A territory which contains no factory brings, obviously, a zero income.

Byteasar, the King of Byteotia, is concerned by the amount of losses the Triangles' invasion could generate. Help him by writing a programme which shall calculate the sum of gains and losses generated by factories which the Triangles wish to capture.

TaskWrite a programme which:

reads a decription of Byteotia's shape and the locations of factories from the input file,     determines the maximal value of sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within a triangle, whose vertices are three different vertices of the polygon island,     writes the outcome to the output file.

给定一个凸包， 并给出凸包内部或边上的若干个资源，每个资源都有权值,现在要在凸包上面选择不同的3个点，使得3个点组成的三角形


内部的资源的权值之和最大。


凸包点个数 $n \le 600$


资源个数 $m \le 10000$


## 输入格式

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$ ($3 \le n \le 600$), denoting the number of vertices of the polygon-island.

The following $n$ lines of the input contain two integers each $x_j$ and $y_j$ ($-10\ 000 \le x_j, y_j \le 10\ 000$), separated by a single space, denoting the coordinates $x$ and $y$ of consecutive vertices of the island, in a clockwise order.

The $(n+2)$-nd line contains a single integer $m$ ($1 \le m \le 10\ 000$), denoting thetotal number of factories.

In each of the following $m$ lines there are three integers $x_i'$, $y_i'$ and $w_i$ ($-10\ 000 \le x_i', y_i' \le 10\ 000$, $-100\ 000 \le w_i \le 100\ 000$), separated by single spaces, denoting: the coordinates $x$ and $y$ of the $i$-th factory and the gain (for $w_i \ge 0$) or loss (for $w_i < 0$) this factory generates, respectively. Each factory is situated on the polygon-island i.e. within or on the border of it. Distinct factories may be located in the same place i.e. have the same coordinates.


## 输出格式

The first and only line of the output file should contain a single integer denoting the maximal value of sum of all gains and losses generated by factories within a triangle whose vertices are three different vertices of the polygon-island. Notice that it may happen that the outcome is a negative integer.
