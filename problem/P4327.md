## 题目描述

“Peter Pan frames” are a way of decorating text in which every character is framed by a diamond shaped frame, with frames of neigbhouring characters interleaving. A Peter Pan frame for one letter looks like this ('X' is the letter we are framing):
```
..#..
.#.#.
#.X.#
.#.#.
..#..
```
However, such a framing would be somewhat dull so we'll frame every third letter using a “Wendyframe”. A Wendy frame looks like this:

```
..*..
.*.*.
*.X.*
.*.*.
..*..
```
When a Wendy frame interleaves with a Peter Pan frame, the Wendy frame (being much nicer) is put on top. For an example of the interleaving check the sample cases.
