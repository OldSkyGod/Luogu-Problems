## 题目描述

We need to arrange M kids in N teams. We begin by placing K kids in each team, starting
from the first to the $N^{th}$
team. When we finish with the $N^{th}$
team, we switch directions and
continue, placing K kids in each team, from the $(N-1)^{th}$
to the first team, respectively. When
we finish with the first team, we switch directions again and continue the process from the
second to the $N^{th}$
team, respectively, and so on until there are no kids left to distribute. For
example, if we have three teams, we will place K kids in teams in the following order: first
team, second team, third team, second team, first team, second team, etc.

If, at any points, there are less than K kids left to place in the current team, we place all the
remaining kids in that team and end the process.

Output the number of kids in each team when the process ends.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains the integers N (2 ≤ N ≤ 200 000), K and M
(1 ≤ K ≤ M ≤ 2 000 000 000) from the task.

## 输出格式

In a single line, output the number of kids in each of the N teams, respectively from the first
to the $N^{th}$
team.
