# [USACO16JAN]Angry Cows G

## 题目背景

【题目描述】


奶牛Bessie设计了一个游戏：“愤怒的奶牛”。游戏的原型是：有一些可爆炸的草堆分布在一条数轴的某些坐标上，玩家用弹弓把一头奶牛发射到数轴上。奶牛砸到数轴上的冲击波会引发附近的草堆爆炸，而被引爆的草堆可能会引爆其他草堆。游戏的目标是玩家用一只奶牛炸掉所有的草堆。


有N个草堆在数轴的不同位置，坐标为x1,x2,….,xn。如果玩家以能量R把奶牛发射到坐标x，就会引爆半径R及以内的的草堆，即坐标范围[x−R,x+R]的草堆都会燃爆，每个被奶牛引爆的草堆又会2次引爆半径R-1及以内的的草堆，2次引爆的草堆又会3次引爆半径R-2及以内的的草堆...直到一次引爆后没有其他草堆被波及或半径为0。


现在只有1头奶牛，能量为R，请计算如果要引爆所有的草堆，最小的R是多少？


【输入格式】


第一行：1个整数N(2≤N≤50,000)。


下面有N行,每行一个整数：x1,x2,…,xn，范围在[0…1,000,000,000]。


【输出格式】


输出最小的能量R，保留1位小数。

## 题目描述

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game: "Angry Cows".  The premise,  which she believes is completely original, is that the player shoots a cow with a slingshot  into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located at various points on a number line; the cow lands with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her landing site, which in turn might set of a chain reaction that causes additional hay bales to explode.  The goal is to use a single cow to start a chain reaction that detonates all the hay bales.


There are $N$ hay bales located at distinct integer positions $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ on the number line.  If a cow is launched with power $R$ landing at position $x$, this will causes a blast of "radius $R$", engulfing all hay bales within the range $x-R \ldo s x+R$.  These hay bales then themselves explode (all simultaneously), each with a blast radius of $R-1$.  Any not-yet-exploded bales caught in these blasts then all explode (all simultaneously) with blast radius $R-2$, and so on.


Please determine the minimum amount of power $R$ with which a single cow may be launched so that, if it lands at an appropriate location, it will cause subsequent detonation of every single hay bale in the scene.


## 输入格式

The first line of input contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 50,000$).  The remaining

$N$ lines all  contain integers $x_1 \ldots x_N$ (each in the range

$0 \ldots 1,000,000,000$).


## 输出格式

Please output the minimum power $R$ with which a cow must be launched in order

to detonate all the hay bales.  Answers should be rounded and printed to exactly

1 decimal point.

## 提示

In this example, a cow launched with power 3 at, say, location 5, will cause

immediate detonation of  hay bales at positions 3 and 8.  These then explode

(simultaneously) each with blast radius 2, engulfing bales at positions 1 and

10, which next explode (simultaneously) with blast radius 1, engulfing the final

bale at position 11, which finally explodes with blast radius 0.
