# [CERC2015]ASCII Addition

## 题目描述

An ASCII art is a matrix of characters, exactly 7 rows high, with each individual character either a dot or the lowercase letter x.

An expression of the form a + b is given, where both a and b are positive integers. The expression is converted into ASCII art by writing all the expression characters (the digits of a and b as well as the + sign) as 7  5 matrices, and concatenating the matrices together with a single column of dot characters between consecutive individual matrices. The exact matrices corresponding to the digits and the + sign are as follows:
