# [NWRRC2013]Flight Boarding Optimization

## 题目描述



Peter is an executive boarding manager in Byteland airport. His job is to optimize the boarding process. The planes in Byteland have $s$ rows, numbered from $1$ to $s$ . Every row has six seats, labeled A to $F$ .

There are $n$ passengers, they form a queue and board the plane one by one. If the i-th passenger sits in a row $r_{i}$ then the difficulty of boarding for him is equal to the number of passengers boarded before him and sit in rows $1$ . . . $r_{i}−1$ . The total difficulty of the boarding is the sum of difficulties for all passengers. For example, if there are ten passengers, and their seats are $6A, 4B, 2E, 5F, 2A, 3F, 1C, 10E, 8B, 5A,$ in the queue order, then the difficulties of their boarding are $0 , 0 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 2 , 0 , 7 , 7 , 5$ , and the total difficulty is $23$ .

To optimize the boarding, Peter wants to divide the plane into $k$ zones. Every zone must be a continuous range of rows. Than the boarding process is performed in $k$ phases. On every phase, one zone is selected and passengers whose seats are in this zone are boarding in the order they were in the initial queue. $ $

In the example above, if we divide the plane into two zones: rows $5-10$ and rows $1-4$ , then during the first phase the passengers will take seats $6A, 5F, 10E, 8B, 5A,$ and during the second phase the passengers will take seats $4B, 2E, 2A, 3F, 1C,$ in this order. The total difficulty of the boarding will be $6$ .

Help Peter to find the division of the plane into $k$ zones which minimizes the total difficulty of the boarding, given a specific queue of passengers.



## 输入格式



The first line contains three integers $n (1 \le n \le 1000) , s (1 \le s \le 1000)$ , and $k (1 \le k \le 50$ ; $k \le s)$ . The next line contains $n$ integers $r_{i} (1 \le r_{i} \le s)$ .

Each row is occupied by at most $6$ passengers.



## 输出格式



Output one number, the minimal possible difficulty of the boarding.
