# [NEERC2015]King’s Inspection

## 题目背景



## 题目描述



King Karl is a responsible and diligent ruler. Each year he travels across his country to make certain that all cities are doing well.

There are $n$ cities in his country and $m$ roads. In order to control the travelers, each road is unidirectional, that is a road from city a to city $b$ can not be passed from $b$ to a .

Karl wants to travel along the roads in such a way that he starts in the capital, visits every non-capital city exactly once, and finishes in the capital again.

As a transport minister, you are obliged to find such a route, or to determine that such a route doesn't exist.



## 输入格式



The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m (2 \le n \le 100 000 , 0 \le m \le n + 20)$ -- the number of cities and the number of roads in the country.

Each of the next $m$ lines contains two integers $a_{i}$ and $b_{i} (1 \le a_{i}, b_{i} \le n)$ , meaning that there is a one-way road from city $a_{i}$ to city $b_{i}.$ Cities are numbered from $1$ to $n$ . The capital is numbered as $1$ .



## 输出格式



If there is a route that passes through each non-capital city exactly once, starting and finishing in the capital, then output $n + 1$ space-separated integers -- a list of cities along the route. Do output the capital city both in the beginning and in the end of the route.

If there is no desired route, output `There is no route, Karl!` (without quotation marks).
