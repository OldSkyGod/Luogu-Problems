# [USACO07NOV]Telephone Wire G

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

Farmer John's cows are getting restless about their poor telephone service; they want FJ to replace the old telephone wire with new, more efficient wire. The new wiring will utilize N (2 ≤ N ≤ 100,000) already-installed telephone poles, each with some heighti meters (1 ≤ heighti ≤ 100). The new wire will connect the tops of each pair of adjacent poles and will incur a penalty cost C × the two poles' height difference for each section of wire where the poles are of different heights (1 ≤ C ≤ 100). The poles, of course, are in a certain sequence and can not be moved.

Farmer John figures that if he makes some poles taller he can reduce his penalties, though with some other additional cost. He can add an integer X number of meters to a pole at a cost of X2.

Help Farmer John determine the cheapest combination of growing pole heights and connecting wire so that the cows can get their new and improved service.

给出若干棵树的高度，你可以进行一种操作：把某棵树增高h，花费为h\*h。


操作完成后连线，两棵树间花费为高度差\*定值c。


求两种花费加和最小值。


## 输入格式

\* Line 1: Two space-separated integers: N and C

\* Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer: heighti


## 输出格式

\* Line 1: The minimum total amount of money that it will cost Farmer John to attach the new telephone wire.
