# [POI2011]WYK-Plot

## 题目描述

We call any sequence of points in the plane a plot.

We intend to replace a given plot $(P_1,\cdots,P_n)$ with another that will    have at most $m$ points ($m\le n$) in such a way that it "resembles" the    original plot best.

The new plot is created as follows. The sequence of points $P_1,\cdots,P_n$ can be partitioned into $s$ ($s\le m$) contiguous subsequences:

$(P_{k_0+1},\cdots,P_{k_1}),(P_{k_1+1},\cdots,P_{k_2}),\cdots,(P_{k_{s-1}+1},\cdots,P_{k_s})$ where $0=k_0<k_1<k_2<\cdots<k_s=n$,and afterwards each subsequence $(P_{k_{i-1}+1},\cdots,P_{k_i})$, for $i=1,\cdots,s$,is replaced by a new point $Q_i$.

In that case we say that each of the points $P_{k_{i-1}+1},\cdots,P_{k_i}$ has been contracted to the point $Q_i$.

As a result a new plot, represented by the points $Q_1,\cdots,Q_s$, is created.

The measure of such plot's resemblance to the original is the maximum distance of all the points $P_1,\cdots,P_n$ to the point it has been contracted to:

$max_{i=1,\cdots,s}(max_{j=k_{i-1}+1,\cdots,k_i}(d(P_j,Q_i)))$    where $d(P_j,Q_i)$ denotes the distance between $P_j$ and $Q_i$, given by the well-known formula:

$d((x_1,y_1),(x_2,y_2))=\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$

An exemplary plot $P_1,\cdots,P_7$ and the new plot $(Q_1,Q_2)$, where $(P_1,\cdots,P_4)$ are contracted to $Q_1$, whereas $(P_5,P_6,P_7)$ to $Q_2$.

For a given plot consisting of $n$ points, you are to find the plot that    resembles it most while having at most $m$ points,    where the partitioning into contiguous subsequences is arbitrary.

Due to limited precision of floating point operations, a result is deemed    correct if its resemblance to the given plot is larger than the optimum    resemblance by at most $0.000001$.

给定n个点，要求把n个点分成不多于m段，使得求出每段的最小覆盖圆的半径后，最大的半径最小。




## 输入格式

In the first line of the standard input there are two integers $n$ and $m$,      $1\le m\le n\le 100\ 000$, separated by a single space.

Each of the following $n$ lines holds two integers, separated by a single space.

The $(i+1)$-th line gives $x_i$,$y_i$,$-1\ 000\ 000\le x_i,y_i\le 1\ 000\ 000$ denoting the coordinates $(x_i,y_i)$ of the point $P_i$.


## 输出格式

In the first line of the standard output one real number $d$ should be printed out,      the resemblance measure of the plot found to the original one.

In the second line of the standard output there should be another integer $s$, $1\le s\le m$.

Next, the following $s$ lines should specify the coordinates of the points $Q_1,\cdots,Q_s$,one point per line.

Thus the $(i+2)$-th line should give two real numbers $u_i$ and $v_i$,      separated by a single space, that denote the coordinates $(u_i,v_i)$ of the point $Q_i$.All the real numbers should be printed with at most 15 digits after the decimal point.
