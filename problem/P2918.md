# [USACO08NOV]Buying Hay S

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

Farmer John is running out of supplies and needs to purchase H (1 <= H <= 50,000) pounds of hay for his cows.

He knows N (1 <= N <= 100) hay suppliers conveniently numbered 1..N. Supplier i sells packages that contain P\_i (1 <= P\_i <= 5,000) pounds of hay at a cost of C\_i (1 <= C\_i <= 5,000) dollars. Each supplier has an unlimited number of packages available, and the packages must be bought whole.

Help FJ by finding the minimum cost necessary to purchase at least H pounds of hay.

约翰的干草库存已经告罄，他打算为奶牛们采购 $H(1 \leq H \leq 50000)$ 磅干草。

他知道 $N(1 \leq N\leq 100)$ 个干草公司，现在用 $1$ 到 $N$ 给它们编号。第 $i$ 公司卖的干草包重量为 $P_i (1 \leq P_i \leq 5,000)$ 磅，需要的开销为 $C_i (1 \leq C_i \leq 5,000)$ 美元。每个干草公司的货源都十分充足， 可以卖出无限多的干草包。

帮助约翰找到最小的开销来满足需要，即采购到至少 $H$ 磅干草。
