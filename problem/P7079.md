# [NWRRC2013]Arrangement of Contest

## 题目描述



Little Dmitry and little Petr want to arrange a contest. Their little friends submitted several task proposals and now Dmitry and Petr want to select some of them for the contest. As they are just little boys, they cannot estimate quality of tasks, but they know for sure that in good contest title of the first problem starts with A , the title of the second one -- with $B$ , and so on.

Given titles of the proposed tasks, help little brothers to determine the maximal number of problems in a good contest they can arrange.



## 输入格式



The first line contains single integer $n$ -- the number of problem proposals received by the little brothers $(1 \le n \le 100)$ .

Next $n$ lines contain titles of proposed problems, one per line. The length of each title does not exceed $30$ characters. Each title starts with an uppercase letter and contains only English letters, digits and underscores.



## 输出格式



Output a single number -- the maximal number of problems in a good contest. In case there is no good contest that may be arranged, output $0$ .
