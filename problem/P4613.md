## 题目描述

Harry Potter has damaged his magic wand in a fight with Lord Voldemort. He has decided to
get a new wand in Olivander's wand shop. On the floor of the shop, he saw ​N wands and ​N
wand boxes. The lengths of the wands are, respectively, $X_1$
,$X_2$
...​$X_n$
, and the box sizes are
$Y_1$
,​$Y_2$
...$Y_n$
. A wand of length ​X can be placed in a box of size ​Y if ​X ≤ ​Y
. Harry wants to know
if he can place all the wands in boxes so that each box contains exactly one wand.
Help him solve this difficult problem.

## 提示

In test cases worth 60% of total points, it will hold ​N
≤ 9.

**Clarification of the first test case:**

Harry can place the wands in boxes. For example, he can place the wand of length 5 in a box of size
6, wand of length 7 in a box of size 13, and wand of length 9 in a box of size 10.

**Clarification of the second test case:**

Harry can’t place the wands in boxes because the box of size 2 can’t fit any of the wands.
