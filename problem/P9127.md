# [USACO23FEB] Equal Sum Subarrays G

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

**Note: The time limit for this problem is 3s, 1.5x the default.** 

FJ gave Bessie an array $a$ of length $N(2 \le N \le 500,−10^{15} \le a_i \le 10^{15})$ with all $\dfrac{N(N+1)}{2}$ contiguous subarray sums distinct. For each index $i \in [1,N]$, help Bessie compute the minimum amount it suffices to change ai by so that there are two different contiguous subarrays of a with equal sum. 

## 输入格式

The first line contains $N$.

The next line contains $a_1, \cdots ,a_N$
(the elements of $a$, in order). 

## 输出格式

One line for each index $i \in [1,N]$.

## 提示

### Explanation for Sample 1

Decreasing $a_1$ by $2$ would result in $a_1+a_2=a_2$. Similarly, increasing $a_2$ by $3$ would result in $a_1+a_2=a_1$. 

### Explanation for Sample 2

Increasing a1 or decreasing $a_3$ by $1$ would result in $a_1=a_3$. Increasing $a_2$ by $6$ would result in $a_1=a_1+a_2+a_3$. 

### SCORING

 - Input $3$: $N \le 40$
 - Input $4$: $N \le 80$
 - Inputs $5-7$: $N \le 200$
 - Inputs 8-16: No additional constraints.
