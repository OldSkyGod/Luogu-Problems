# [POI2011]Lightning Conductor

## 题目描述

Progressive climate change has forced the Byteburg authorities to build a huge lightning conductor    that would protect all the buildings within the city.

These buildings form a row along a single street, and are numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.2.png).

The heights of the buildings and the lightning conductor are non-negative integers.

Byteburg's limited funds allow construction of only a single lightning conductor.

Moreover, as you would expect, the higher it will be, the more expensive.

The lightning conductor of height ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.3.png) located on the roof of the building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.4.png) (of height ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.5.png))    protects the building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.6.png) (of height ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.7.png)) if the following inequality holds:

![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.8.png)        where ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.9.png) denotes the absolute value of the difference between ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.10.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.11.png).

Byteasar, the mayor of Byteburg, asks your help.

Write a program that, for every building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.12.png), determines the minimum height    of a lightning conductor that would protect all the buildings if it were put    on top of the building ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.13.png).




## 输入格式

In the first line of the standard input there is a single integer    ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.14.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.15.png)) that denotes the number of buildings in Byteburg.

Each of the following ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.16.png) lines holds a single integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.17.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.18.png))    that denotes the height of the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.19.png)-th building.


## 输出格式

Your program should print out exactly ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.20.png) lines to the standard output.

The ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.21.png)-th line should give a non-negative integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.22.png) denoting the minimum    height of the lightning conductor on the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI18/pio-en-tex.23.png)-th building.
