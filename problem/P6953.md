## 题目描述

A net of the corresponding parallelepiped is cut out of a flat rectangular piece of cardboard of size $w$ *h . This net is a polygon with sides parallel to the sides of the rectangle of the cardboard. The net is bent along several lines and is connected along the edges of the resulting parallelepiped to form a box. The net is bent only along the edges of the resulting box.
