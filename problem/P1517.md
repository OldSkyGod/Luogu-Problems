# 高精求小数幂

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

Problems involving the computation of exact values of very large magnitude and precision are common. For example, the computation of the national debt is a taxing experience for many computer systems.

This problem requires that you write a program to compute the exact value of Rn where R is a real number ( 0.0 < R <= 9999.9) and n is an integer such that 0 < n <= 250.


## 输入格式

The input will consist of a set (less than 11) of pairs of values for R and n. The R value will occupy columns 1 through 6, and the n value will be in columns 8 and 9.

   
 

## 输出格式

The output will consist of one line for each line of input giving the exact value of R^n. Leading zeros should be suppressed in the output. Insignificant trailing zeros must not be printed. Don't print the decimal point if the result is an integer.

## 提示

If you don't know how to determine wheather encounted the end of input:

s is a string and n is an integer

C++
while(cin>>s>>n) 

{ 
...
} 
c
while(scanf("%s%d",s,&n)==2) //to see if the scanf read in as many items as you want


{ 
...
}
