## 题目描述



Anna has just finished her course project. She has a lot of seven-segment LED displays as leftovers and a small power source. Each display consumes power proportionally to the number of lit segments, e.g . $‘9'$ consumes twice more power than $‘7'.$

Anna wonders what is the maximum possible sum of digits she is able to achieve, if her power source is able to light $n$ segments, and she wants to light exactly $n$ segments.



## 输入格式



The single line of the input contains one integer $n$ -- the number of segments that should be lit $(2 \le n \le 10^{6}).$



## 输出格式



Output a single integer -- the maximum possible sum of digits that can be displayed simultaneously.
