# [NWRRC2015]Easy Arithmetic

## 题目描述



Eva is a third-grade elementary school student. She has just learned how to perform addition and subtraction of arbitrary-precision integers. Her homework is to evaluate some expressions. It is boring, so she decided to add a little trick to the homework. Eva wants to add some plus and minus signs to the expression to make its value as large as possible.



## 输入格式



The single line of the input file contains the original arithmetic expression. It contains only digits, plus $(‘+')$ and minus $(‘-')$ signs.

The original expression is correct, that is:

numbers have no leading zeroes;

there are no two consecutive signs;

the last character of the expression is a digit.

The length of the original expression does not exceed $1000$ characters.



## 输出格式



Output a single line -- the original expression with some plus and minus signs added. Output expression must satisfy the same correctness constraints as the original one. Its value must be as large as possible.
