# [NWRRC2015]Hash Code Hacker

## 题目描述



According to Java standard library documentation, the hash code of String is computed as

$s[0] \times 31 ^ {n -1} + s[1] \times 31 ^ {n -2} + \cdots + s[n -1]$

Here $s[i]$ is the i-th character of the string, $n$ is the length of the string, and $^$ indicates exponentiation. Computation uses signed $32-bit$ integers in two's complement form.

Heather is going to hack the servers of Not Entirely Evil Recording Company $(NEERC).$ To perform an attack she needs $k$ distinct query strings that have equal hash codes. Unfortunately, NEERC servers accept query string containing lower- and uppercase English letters only.

Heather hired you to write a program that generates such query strings for her.



## 输入格式



The single line of the input file contains integer $k$ -- the number of required query strings to generate $(2 \le k \le 1000)$ .



## 输出格式



Output $k$ lines. Each line should contain a single query string. Each query string should be non-empty and its length should not exceed $1000$ characters. Query string should contain only lower- and uppercase English letters. All query strings should be distinct and should have equal hash codes.
