# [BalticOI 2016 day1]Spiral

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

A grid of size $(2n+1)\times(2n+1)$ has been constructed as follows. Number $1$ has been placed in the center square, number $2$ has been placed to the right of it, and the following numbers have been placed along the spiral counterclockwise.

Your task is to calculate answers for $q$ queries where the sum of numbers in an rectangular region in the grid is requested (modulo $10^9+7$). For example, in the following grid $n=2$ and the sum of numbers in the gray region is $74$ :

## 输入格式

The first input line contains two integers $n$ and $q$ : the size of the grid and the number of queries.

After this, there are $q$ lines, each containing four integers $x_1, y_1, x_2$  and $y_2$ ($-n\leq x_1\leq x_2\leq n, -n\leq y_1\leq y_2\leq n$). This means that you should calculate the sum of numbers in a rectangular region with corners $(x_1,y_1)$ and $(x_2,y_2)$.

## 输出格式

You should output the answer for each query (modulo $10^9+7$).
