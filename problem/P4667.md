# [BalticOI 2011 Day1]Switch the Lamp On

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

Casper is designing an electronic circuit on a $N \times M$ rectangular grid plate. There are $N \times M$ square tiles that are aligned to the grid on the plate. Two (out of four) opposite corners of each tile are connected by a wire.

A power source is connected to the top left corner of the plate. A lamp is connected to the bottom right corner of the plate. The lamp is on only if there is a path of wires connecting power source to lamp. In order to switch the lamp on, any number of tiles can be turned by 90° (in both directions).

In the picture above the lamp is off. If any one of the tiles in the second column from the right is turned by 90° , power source and lamp get connected, and the lamp is on.

Write a program to find out the minimal number of tiles that have to be turned by 90° to switch the lamp on.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains two integer numbers $N$ and $M$, the dimensions of the plate. In each of the following $N$ lines there are $M$ symbols – either \ or / – which indicate the direction of the wire connecting the opposite vertices of the corresponding tile.

## 输出格式

There must be exactly one line of output. If it is possible to switch the lamp on, this line must contain only one integer number: the minimal number of tiles that have to be turned to switch on the lamp. If it is not possible, output the string: ``NO SOLUTION``
