# [USACO08DEC]Patting Heads S

## 题目描述

It's Bessie's birthday and time for party games! Bessie has instructed the N (1 <= N <= 100,000) cows conveniently numbered 1..N to sit in a circle (so that cow i [except at the ends] sits next to cows i-1 and i+1; cow N sits next to cow 1). Meanwhile, Farmer John fills a barrel with one billion slips of paper, each containing some integer in the range 1..1,000,000.

Each cow i then draws a number A\_i (1 <= A\_i <= 1,000,000) (which is not necessarily unique, of course) from the giant barrel.  Taking turns, each cow i then takes a walk around the circle and pats the heads of all other cows j such that her number A\_i is exactly

divisible by cow j's number A\_j; she then sits again back in her original position.

The cows would like you to help them determine, for each cow, the number of other cows she should pat.
