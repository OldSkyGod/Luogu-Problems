# [POI2009]LYZ-Ice Skates

## 题目描述

Byteasar runs a skate club. Its members meet on a regular basis and train    together, and they always use the club's ice-skates. The skate sizes are    (by convention) numbered from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.1.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.2.png). Naturally, each club member has    some foot size, but that is not all to it! Skaters have skate size tolerance    factor ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.3.png): a skater with foot size ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.4.png) can wear skates with    sizes from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.5.png) up to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.6.png). It should be noted, though, that    no skater ever wears two skates of different size simultaneously.

To supply the club, Byteasar bought ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.7.png) pairs of ice-skates of each size,    i.e. from ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.8.png) to ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.9.png). As time passes, some people join the club, just as    some established members leave it. Byteasar worries if he will have enough    skates of appropriate size for every member at each training.

We assume that initially the club has no members at all. Byteasar will give    you a sequence of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.10.png) events of the following form: ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.11.png) (new) members with    foot size ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.12.png) have joined/left the club. Right after each such event    Byteasar wants to know whether he has enough skates of appropriate size for    every club member. He asks you to write a programme that will check it for    him.


## 输入格式

The first line of the standard input contains four integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.13.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.14.png),      ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.15.png) and ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.16.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.17.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.18.png),      ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.19.png), ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.20.png)), separated by single spaces, that      denote, respectively: maximum skate size, number of events, number of      skate pairs of each size Byteasar initially bought, and the skate size      tolerance factor. The following ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.21.png) lines contain the sequence of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.22.png)      events, one per line. The ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.23.png)-th line (for ![](http://main.edu.pl…


## 输出格式

Your programme should print out ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.35.png) lines to the standard output.

The ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.36.png)-th line (for ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.37.png)) should either contain the word      TAK (Polish for yes), or the word NIE (Polish for      no), depending on whether Byteasar has the skates of appropriate      size for every club member right after the ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI16/lyz-en-tex.38.png)-th event.
