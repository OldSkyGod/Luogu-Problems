# [USACO06NOV]Bad Hair Day S

## 题目描述

Some of Farmer John's N cows (1 ≤ N ≤ 80,000) are having a bad hair day! Since each cow is self-conscious about her messy hairstyle, FJ wants to count the number of other cows that can see the top of other cows' heads.

Each cow i has a specified height hi (1 ≤ hi ≤ 1,000,000,000) and is standing in a line of cows all facing east (to the right in our diagrams). Therefore, cow i can see the tops of the heads of cows in front of her (namely cows i+1, i+2, and so on), for as long as these cows are strictly shorter than cow i.

Consider this example:

```
        -
-       -
-   -   -
-   -   -
- - - - -
- - - - - -
1 2 3 4 5 6

Cows facing right -->

```

Cow#1 can see the hairstyle of cows #2, 3, 4

Cow#2 can see no cow's hairstyle

Cow#3 can see the hairstyle of cow #4

Cow#4 can see no cow's hairstyle

Cow#5 can see the hairstyle of cow 6

Cow#6 can see no cows at all!

Let ci denote the number of cows whose hairstyle is visible from cow i; please compute the sum of c1 through cN.For this example, the desired is answer 3 + 0 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 5.


## 输入格式

Line 1: The number of cows, N.


Lines 2..N+1: Line i+1 contains a single integer that is the height of cow i.


## 输出格式

Line 1: A single integer that is the sum of c1 through cN.
