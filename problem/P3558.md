# [POI2013]BAJ-Bytecomputer

## 题目描述

A sequence of ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.1.png) integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.2.png) from the set ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.3.png) is given.

The bytecomputer is a device that allows the following operation on the sequence:

incrementing ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.4.png) by ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.5.png) for any ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.6.png).

There is no limit on the range of integers the bytecomputer can store, i.e.,    each ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.7.png) can (in principle) have arbitrarily small or large value.

Program the bytecomputer so that it transforms the input sequence into a non-decreasing sequence    (i.e., such that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.8.png)) with the minimum number of operations.



## 输入格式

The first line of the standard input holds a single integer ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.9.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.10.png)),      the number of elements in the (bytecomputer's) input sequence.

The second line contains ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.11.png) integers ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.12.png) (![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.13.png))      that are the successive elements of the (bytecomputer's) input sequence, separated by single spaces.

In tests worth 24% of the total points it holds that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.14.png),      and in tests worth 48% of the total points it holds that ![](http://main.edu.pl/images/OI20/baj-en-tex.15.png).


## 输出格式

The first and only line of the standard output should give one integer,      the minimum number of operations the bytecomputer has to perform to make its input sequence non-decreasing,      of the single word BRAK (Polish for none) if obtaining such a sequence is impossible.
