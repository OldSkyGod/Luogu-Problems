# [COI2007] Policija

## 题目描述

To help capture criminals on the run, the police are introducing a new computer system. The area covered by the police contains N cities and E bidirectional roads connecting them. The cities are labelled 1 to N.

为了帮助抓捕逃犯，警方引进了一套新的电脑系统。警察的辖区包含N座城市和E条双向道路，城市的编号是1~N。

The police often want to catch criminals trying to get from one city to another. Inspectors, looking at a map, try to determine where to set up barricades and roadblocks. The new computer system should answer the following two types of queries:

警察常常要抓住那些逃往另一个城市的罪犯。侦查员看着地图，试着确定在哪里设置路障。新的计算机系统要回答以下两种问题：

1. Consider two cities A and B, and a road connecting cities G1 and G2. Can the criminals get
from city A to city B if that one road is blocked and the criminals can't use it?

1.考虑城市$A$和$B$，以及连接城市$G_1$和$G_2$的道路。罪犯能否在那条路不通的情况下从$A$到逃到$B$？

2. Consider three cities A, B and C. Can the criminals get from city A to city B if the entire city
C is cut off and the criminals can't enter that city?

2.考虑三个城市$A$、$B$、$C$。罪犯能否在$C$被切断的情况下从$A$逃到$B$?

Write a program that implements the described system.

写一个程序实现上述系统。


## 输入格式

The first line contains two integers N and E (2 ≤ N ≤ 100 000, 1 ≤ E ≤ 500 000), the number of cities and roads.

Each of the following E lines contains two distinct integers between 1 and N – the labels of two cities connected by a road. There will be at most one road between any pair of cities.

The following line contains the integer Q (1 ≤ Q ≤ 300 000), the number of queries the system is being tested on.

Each of the following Q lines contains either four or five integers. The first of these integers is the type of the query – 1 or 2.

If the query is of type 1, then the same line contains four more integers A, B, G1 and G2 as described earlier. A and B will be different. G1 and G2 will represent an existing road.

If the query is of type 2, then the same line contains three more integers A, B and C. A, B and C will be distinct integers.

The test data will be such that it is initially possible to get from each city to every other city.

## 输出格式

Output the answers to all Q queries, one per line. The answer to a query can be "yes" or "no".
