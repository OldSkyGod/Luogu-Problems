# [NWRRC2016]Boys and Girls

## 题目描述



Bob found a nice task in his old math book for children. It says:

There are $10$ children standing in a circle, $5$ of them stand next to a boy, and $7$ of them stand next to a girl. How is it possible?

Here is the solution to the task. If $4$ boys and $6$ girls stand like this: BGBGBGBGGG, there are $5$ children who stand next to a boy (here they are underlined: BGBGBGBGGG), and $7$ children who stand next to a girl $(BGBGBGBGGG).$

Now Bob wants to solve a generalized version of this task:

There are $n$ children standing in a circle, $x$ of them stand next to a boy, and $y$ of them stand next to a girl. How is it possible?

Help Bob by writing a program that solves the generalized task.



## 输入格式



The single line of the input contains three integers $n , x$ and $y (2 \le n \le 100 000$ ; $0 \le x , y \le n)$ .



## 输出格式



If there is a solution, output a string of length $n$ , describing the order of children in the circle. $Character ‘G'$ corresponds to a girl, character $‘B'$ corresponds to a boy. If there are several solutions, output any $of the_m.$

If there is no solution, output `Impossible`.
