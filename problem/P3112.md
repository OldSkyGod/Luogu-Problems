# [USACO14DEC]Guard Mark G

## 题目描述

 Farmer John and his herd are playing frisbee.  Bessie throws thefrisbee down the field, but it's going straight to Mark the field handon the other team!  Mark has height H (1 <= H <= 1,000,000,000), butthere are N cows on Bessie's team gathered around Mark (2 <= N <= 20).They can only catch the frisbee if they can stack up to be at least ashigh as Mark.  Each of the N cows has a height, weight, and strength.A cow's strength indicates the maximum amount of total weight of thecows that can be stacked above her. 
 
 Given these constraints, Bessie wants to know if it is possible forher team to build a tall enough stack to catch the frisbee, and if so,what is the maximum safety factor of such a stack.  The safety factorof a stack is the amount of weight that can be added to the top of thestack without exceeding any cow's strength.




## 输入格式

INPUT: (file guard.in) 

The first line of input contains N and H.

The next N lines of input each describe a cow, giving its height,weight, and strength.  All are positive integers at most 1 billion.

 

## 输出格式

OUTPUT: (file guard.out) 

 If Bessie's team can build a stack tall enough to catch the frisbee, please output the maximum achievable safety factor for such a stack. 

Otherwise output "Mark is too tall" (without the quotes).
