# [CERC2014]Outer space invaders

## 题目描述

The aliens from outer space have (finally!) invaded Earth. Defend yourself, or be disintegrated!

Or assimilated. Or eaten. We are not yet sure.

The aliens follow a known attack pattern. There are $n$ attackers, the $i-th$ one appears at time $a_i$, at distance $d_i$ from you. He must be destroyed no later than at time $b_i$, or else he will fire his weapon, which will definitely end the fight.

Your weapon is an area-blaster, which can be set to any given power. If fired with power $R$,it momentarily destroys all aliens at distance $R$ or smaller. It also consumes $R$ fuel cells.

Determine the minimal cost (measured in fuel cells) of destroying all the aliens, without being killed.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains the number of test cases $T$. The descriptions of the test cases follow:

Each test case starts with a line containing the number of aliens $n(1 \le n \le 300)$. Of the next $n$ lines, the $i-th$ one contains three integers $a_i, b_i, d_i, (1 \le a_i < b_i \le 10 000, 1 \le d_i \le 10 000)$.

The $i-th$ alien appears at time $a_i$, is idle until $b_i$, and his distance from you is $d_i$.


## 输出格式

For each test case, output one line containing the minimum number of cells needed to destroy all the aliens.
