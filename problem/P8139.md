# [ICPC2020 WF] Sweep Stakes

## 题目描述

You may have already won! In fact, you did already win! You won your very own
island, in the deepest reaches of the unexplored ocean! Well, mostly unexplored.
As it happens, there was a small military base there before you, and when they
packed up and flew out they left behind an assortment of scraps, munitions,
tunnels, $\ldots$ and unexploded defensive ordnance. That's right: You now possess
your very own minefield.

The minefield consists of an $m\times n$ grid, with any square of the grid holding
0 or 1 mines. Fortunately, you were able to recover the engineers' plans from when
they deployed the mines. Unfortunately, the exact locations of the mines were never
written down: the engineers had a preselected independent probability of deploying
a mine in each square. However, you do know how many mines were placed in total.

You would like to estimate how safe various parts of your island are. Write a
program to compute the probability of mine counts over various subsets of the
minefield.

## 输入格式

The first line of input contains four integers $m$, $n$, $t$, and $q$, where $m$
and $n$ ($1 \leq m,n \leq 500$) are the dimensions of the minefield, $t$ 
($0 \leq t \leq mn$) is the total number of mines, and $q$ ($0 \leq q \leq 500$)
is the number of queries. The second line contains $m$ real numbers 
$p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_m$ ($0 \leq p_i \leq 0.1$ for all $i$, with at most six digits
after the decimal point specified), and the third line
contains $n$ real numbers $q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n$ ($0 \leq q_j \leq 0.1$ for all
$j$, with at most six digits after the decimal point specified).
The preselected probability of the engineers placing a mine on square $(i, j)$
is $p_i + q_j$. All choices of whether to place a mine on a given square were made
independently, and the value of $t$ is chosen so that the probability of deploying
exactly $t$ mines is at least $10^{-5}$. 

Each of the remaining $q$ lines describes a single query. Each of those lines
begins with an integer $s$ ($0 \leq s \leq 500$), followed by $s$ pairs of integers
$i$ and $j$ ($1 \leq i \leq m$, $1 \leq j \leq n$), which are the coordinates of $s$
distinct squares in the grid.

## 输出格式

For each query with $s$ squares, output $s+1$ real numbers, which are the
probabilities of the $s$ given squares containing $0, 1, \ldots, s$ mines. Your
answer should have an absolute error of at most $10^{-6}$.
