# [CERC2015]Frightful Formula

## 题目描述

A frightful matrix is a square matrix of order n where the ﬁrst row and the ﬁrst column are explicitly speciﬁed, while the other elements are calculated using a frightful formula which is, actually, a simple recursive rule. 

Given two integer sequences l and t,both of size n,as well as integer parameters a,b and c,the frightful matrix F is deﬁned as follows:

* The ﬁrst column of the matrix is the sequence l: 

$$F[k, 1] = lk$$ 

* The ﬁrst row of the matrix is the sequence t: 

$$F[1, k] = tk$$ 

* Other elements are calculated using a recursive formula: 

$$F[i,j]=a*F[i,j-1]+b*F[i-1,j]+c$$

Given a frightful matrix, ﬁnd the value of the element $F[n,n]$ modulo $10^6 +3$.

## 输入格式

The ﬁrst line contains four integers n, a, b and c (2≤n≤200000, 0≤ a, b, c≤$10^6$) – the size of the matrix and the recursion parameters, as described in the problem statement. 

The two following lines contain integers l1,...,ln and t1,...,tn, respectively (l1 = t1, 0≤lk, tk ≤106). 

## 输出格式

Output a single integer – the value of $F[n,n]$ modulo $10^6 +3$.
