# [USACO16JAN]Angry Cows G

## 题目描述

Bessie the cow has designed what she thinks will be the next big hit video game: "Angry Cows".  The premise,  which she believes is completely original, is that the player shoots a cow with a slingshot  into a one-dimensional scene consisting of a set of hay bales located at various points on a number line; the cow lands with sufficient force to detonate the hay bales in close proximity to her landing site, which in turn might set of a chain reaction that causes additional hay bales to explode.  The goal is to use a single cow to start a chain reaction that detonates all the hay bales.


There are $N$ hay bales located at distinct integer positions $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_N$ on the number line.  If a cow is launched with power $R$ landing at position $x$, this will causes a blast of "radius $R$", engulfing all hay bales within the range $x-R \ldo s x+R$.  These hay bales then themselves explode (all simultaneously), each with a blast radius of $R-1$.  Any not-yet-exploded bales caught in these blasts then all explode (all simultaneously) with blast radius $R-2$, and so on.


Please determine the minimum amount of power $R$ with which a single cow may be launched so that, if it lands at an appropriate location, it will cause subsequent detonation of every single hay bale in the scene.


## 输入格式

The first line of input contains $N$ ($2 \leq N \leq 50,000$).  The remaining

$N$ lines all  contain integers $x_1 \ldots x_N$ (each in the range

$0 \ldots 1,000,000,000$).


## 输出格式

Please output the minimum power $R$ with which a cow must be launched in order

to detonate all the hay bales.  Answers should be rounded and printed to exactly

1 decimal point.

## 提示

In this example, a cow launched with power 3 at, say, location 5, will cause

immediate detonation of  hay bales at positions 3 and 8.  These then explode

(simultaneously) each with blast radius 2, engulfing bales at positions 1 and

10, which next explode (simultaneously) with blast radius 1, engulfing the final

bale at position 11, which finally explodes with blast radius 0.
