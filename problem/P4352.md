# [CERC2015]Greenhouse Growth

## 题目背景



## 题目描述

You are switching from computer science to agriculture and your new job involves growing sunﬂowers in an underground greenhouse. The greenhouse contains n sunﬂower plants arranged in a straight line and numbered with integers 1 through n, from left to right. Two lamps provide the light and heat the sunﬂowers need to grow: the lamp A is positioned at the left end, while the lamp B is positioned at the right end of the line. 

Every day exactly one of the lamps is on, causing all of the sunﬂowers to turn towards the light and some of them to grow. The sunﬂower will grow if and only if the sunﬂower directly in front of it (towards the light) is higher. The growth is continuous with a uniform rate of exactly 1 centimeter per day. Notice that, when a sunﬂower starts to grow, it may cause the sunﬂower directly behind it to start to grow instantaneously.

You are given initial heights of the sunﬂowers and the lamp schedule for the following m day period, ﬁnd the ﬁnal heights of all the sunﬂowers.

## 输入格式

The ﬁrst line contains two integers n and m (1≤n, m≤300000) – the number of sunﬂowers and the number of days in the period. The following line contains n integers h1,h2,...,hn (1≤ hk ≤$10^9$) – the initial heights (in centimeters) of the sunﬂowers, from left to right. 

The following line contains a string consisting of exactly m characters A or B – the lamp schedule starting from the ﬁrst day of the period.

## 输出格式

Output a single line containing n integers – the ﬁnal heights of the sunﬂowers, from left to right.
