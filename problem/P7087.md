## 题目描述



Erast Kopi is famous Sudoku puzzle designer. Resounding success of his puzzle compilations caused a number of imitations and plagiarisms. Prior to sending a lawsuit he decided to get more evidence.

Sudoku puzzle is a table $9 \times 9$ , divided into $3 \times 3$ subtables of $3 \times 3$ cells each. Each cell may contain a digit from $1$ to $9$ . The task is to fill empty cells with digits in a way that each row, each column and each of the $9$ subtables $3 \times 3$ contains each digit from $1$ to $9$ exactly once.

Kopi has a database of Sudoku puzzles and he wants to check if it contains similar puzzles. The puzzle $P$ is similar to the puzzle $Q$ , if it is possible to transform the puzzle $P$ into the puzzle $Q$ using a sequence of the following operations:

choose two digits $x$ and $y$ and replace all digits $x$ with $y$ and vice versa;

swap two triples of rows: $(1 , 2 , 3) , (4 , 5 , 6) , (7 , 8 , 9)$ ;

swap two rows in one triple of rows;

swap two triples of columns: $(1 , 2 , 3) , (4 , 5 , 6) , (7 , 8 , 9)$ ;

swap two columns in one triple of columns;

flip along top-left -- bottom-right axis. After this operation columns become rows and vice versa.

Help Kopi to find similar puzzles in his database.



## 输入格式



The first line of the input contains single integer $n$ -- the number of puzzles in the database $(1 \le n \le 20)$ .

The rest of the input contains description of $n$ puzzles: $P_1 , P_2$ , . . . , Pn. Each puzzle is described by nine lines that contain nine characters each. Each character is either a digit from $1$ to $9$ , or a dot $(‘. ')$ denoting an empty cell. An empty line separates consecutive puzzles in the database.

There are no spaces in the input file.

The puzzles are not guaranteed to be solvable.



## 输出格式



Check if the puzzle $P_1$ is similar to puzzles $P_2$ , P3 , . . . , $P_n$ (in this order), than check if the puzzle $P_2$ is similar to puzzles P3 , P4 , . . . , $P_n$ (in this order) and so on.

If the puzzle $P_i$ is similar to the puzzle $Pj (1 \le i < j \le n)$ output `Yes`, otherwise output `No`. If the answer is positive, the next line should contain an integer qij -- the number of operations required to transform the puzzle $P_i$ to the puzzle $Pj$ . The number of operations is not required to be minimal, however it must not exceed $1000$ . In the following qij lines write the operations that transform the puzzle $P_i$ to the puzzle $Pj$ , one per line.

Operations are encoded in the following way:

`D $x$ y` for swapping digits $x$ and $y$ ;

`R a b` for swapping triples of rows (3a $− 2$ , 3a $− 1 , 3a)$ and (3b $− 2$ , 3b $− 1 , 3b);$

`r a b` for swapping rows a and $b$ , rows must belong to same triple of rows;

`C a b` for swapping triples of columns (3a $− 2$ , 3a $− 1 , 3a)$ and (3b $− 2$ , 3b $− 1 , 3b);$

`c a b` for swapping columns a and $b$ , columns must belong to same triple of columns;

`F` for flipping along top-left -- bottom-right axis.

The columns are numbered from left to right and the rows are numbered from top to bottom as they are given in the input file, starting from one.
